          Implementing data access functionality is a core activity of most developers working with the .NET Framework.
          In a tied architecture the data access layers  are an essential part of applications. This block (the CA.Blocks.DataAccess assembly)
          creates an abstract data access layer which can use used as a base for accessing those databases in a convenient and
          standardized way. The block is made up of a Core DataAccess Class and then specializations for specific providers
          such as SQL server and generic OLEDB implementation.  It is designed to be the base class through which
          a standardized DataAccess Layer can be built.
